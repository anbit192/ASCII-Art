# ASCII-Art
My own implementation of ascii art and video, example: Bad apple </br>
still working on audio sync

how to run:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- rename .env.example to .env 
- run start.py

---
config .env:
- level: Number of ASCII characters used to draw ASCII art 
- Output H&W: H&W of ASCII art
- FPS: change the fps

If the display looks buggy and the keep scrolling, try to set the font of your cmd smaller
